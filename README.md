# NYC bikesharing with Citbike and Tableau - Challenge Number 14

## Overview

For this challenge we evaluated citibike data in New York City using Tableau and Pandas.  By revising the inital dataset and extracting the data into a new csv file, we were able to provide specific visualizations showing different demographics.  As a result of the end of the analysis, we were able to create 5 different visualizations breaking down the citibike data trips by gender, usertype and weekdays.  The link to my Tableau Public profile with the visulations can be found below.
